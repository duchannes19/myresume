    "cipensaele.description": "<p>This application is a web-based calendar and scheduling system that consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions, while the backend handles the logic and data management.</p><p>The React frontend utilizes components and state management to create a responsive and interactive user interface. It includes features such as displaying a calendar view, scheduling appointments, managing reservations, and generating reports. The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP requests to fetch and update data.</p><p>On the backend, Node.js is used to build a server-side application that handles the business logic and data operations. It provides APIs for the frontend to interact with, enabling functionalities such as creating, updating, and deleting calendar events, managing user authentication and authorization, and handling various data-related operations. The backend communicates with a database to store and retrieve data securely.</p><p>The application implements various features to enhance user experience and performance. Caching strategies are utilized to optimize data retrieval and minimize server requests. The application also incorporates encryption techniques to secure sensitive data, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.</p><p>The <b>code</b> is hosted on my Github and is private as well as the <b>website</b>.</p>",

    "dohr.description": "The project involves the creation of a website that acts as an online interface for the video game, creating a virtual environment in which players can exchange additional information about the game world and manage their inventory. The interface itself is designed to be simple and intuitive, but at the same time aesthetically consistent with the theme of the video game.",

    "angel.description": "The following project is a tool used to analyze URL requests during navigation and evaluate the security of the website based on the predictions of a Convolutional Neural Network. The tool is implemented as a Chrome extension and a Flask server. The extension intercepts requests made by the browser and sends them to the server for analysis. The server uses a model trained by us with a modified dataset to predict the security of the website based on the URL and sends the result back to the extension. The extension then displays the result to the user.",
